# DisplayShift
Switch Displays in Groups

## What can it do?
DisplayShift allows you to switch between different groups of displays with single click!  
Configure your displays in group A and B, then each time you run it, it will switch between these two groups.  

## Why I made it?
I have a Dell Dock with 2 monitors on the desk near my bed, and I usually connect my Surface Pro to it.  
I use the monitors for coding in day time, and I use built-in display at night for Galgames.  
I don't want to unplug the dock every time, and I don't want to use the fucking slow Windows settings to manually enable/disable displays.  
So I made this tool, now I can switch between display configurations with a single click!
